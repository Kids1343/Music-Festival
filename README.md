# Music-Festival-
With the help of a toggle button, the Tailwind online application, which is responsive to different screen sizes, features dark mode.

  The primary custom waveform logo animation is on the Music-Festival website. The website has a navigation bar, menu items with transitions, submenu items that use tailwind CSS group functionality, and mobile menu functionality with a custom group open tailwind variation. The scrollable, clickable carousel and lineup combine to create a visually appealing timeline.

  The website implements light and dark mode dependent on the user's local computer settings or toggle button, which makes it interesting.

### Downloading code snapshots

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

### Running the attached code
To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder(Music-Festival) via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder).

**Important:** If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use **your backend URLs** or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).
